RESTful-notifications
----------------------
If a tweet is sent into a forest and no one is around does it make a sound?  

Motivation
-----------
The web is visually crowded. This is an experiment to see if repeated, gradually increasing in volume, natural sounds could serve as gentle, stress-free reminders of the life that occurs around us. With these notifications, I hope to reduce my context switches, stop obsessively checking email and facebook, yet stay connected.


Rant
-----

Every website that I stay signed into has taken it upon themselves to obnoxiously beep at me when I have missed a message or update. It makes me context switch from what I am doing over to the message which could have waited. Also it is beautiful outside.  
I want to reduce the visual and audio __screaming__ and replace it with calm and soothing background noise. I am forever tied to my email and facebook account; however, they are in the background of the mind. With RESTful-notifications they become a soothing background to my life.

Why Sound?
----------

Visually the internet is a crowded space and audio is either annoying (remember when a song would start playing on someone's website and you weren't sure how to turn it off?) or a deliberate act, ie. time to listen to music on youtube or whatever. The background auditory space is completely empty besides some youtube videos that help you fall asleep.

Why No Visuals?
----------------

I understand that alerting users that something is happening in their area with louder and more frequent bird chirping but not linking them to it forces them to take another step but I don't want to add to the visual noise of the browsing experience and in my own testing the extra step has not been too large of a deterrent.
